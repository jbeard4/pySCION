[SCION](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION) is an implementation of [SCXML](http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) in JavaScript. 

**pySCION** provides lightweight bindings to the SCION library for Python, via the [python-spidermonkey](https://github.com/davisp/python-spidermonkey) language bindings. This allows SCXML to easily be used in Python development.

To use pySCION, you will need to build python-spidermonkey for your platform. The included Makefile should build python-spidermonkey for Ubuntu. To build on Mac OS X, see python-spidermonkey's project page. Note that python-spidermonkey does not currently support Windows.

For a basic usage example of usage, see [test.py](https://github.com/jbeard4/pySCION/blob/master/test.py)
